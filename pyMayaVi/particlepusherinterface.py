class particlepusherinterface(MayaviGrid):
   ''' This class is used to plot the data in a vlsv file as a mayavi grid The following will bring up a new window and plot the grid in the vlsv file:

   .. code-block:: python

      grid = pt.grid.MayaviGrid(vlsvReader=f, variable="rho", operator='pass', threaded=False)

   Once you have the window open you can use the picker tool in the right-upper corner and use various point-click tools for analyzing data.

   Picker options:
   
   **None** Does nothing upon clicking somewhere in the grid
   
   **Velocity_space** Plots the velocity space at a specific position upon clicking somewhere in the grid Note: If the vlsv file does not have the velocity space at the position where you are clicking, this will not work
   
   **Velocity_space_iso_surface** Plots the velocity space at a specific position upon clicking somewhere in the grid in iso-surface plotting style Note: If the vlsv file does not have the velocity space at the position where you are clicking, this will not work
   
   **Velocity_space_nearest_cellid** Plots the velocity space of the closest cell id to the picking point Note: If the vlsv file does not have velocity space saved at all, this will not work
   
   **Velocity_space_nearest_cellid_iso_surface** Plots the velocity space of the closest cell id to the picking point in iso-surface plotting style Note: If the vlsv file does not have velocity space saved at all, this will not work
   
   **Pitch_angle** Plots the pitch angle distribution at the clicking position Note: If the vlsv file does not have the velocity space at the position where you are clicking, this will not work
   
   **Gyrophase_angle** Plots the gyrophase angle distribution at the clicking position Note: If the vlsv file does not have the velocity space at the position where you are clicking, this will not work
   
   **Cut_through** Is used to plot or save the cut-through between two clicking points. This option requires you to use the args section at top-left. To use the args section to plot variables you must write for example: **plot rho B,x E,y** Upon clicking at two points a new window would open with a cut-through plot of rho, x-component of B and y-component of E Alternatively, you can save the cut-through to a variable in the MayaviGrid class by typing instead: **rho B,x E,y** and then going to the terminal and typing

   **Particle_pusher**
   
   .. code-block:: python

      cut_through_data = grid.cut_through
      print cut_through_data
